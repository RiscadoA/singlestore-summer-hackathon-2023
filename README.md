# Project for the SingleStore Summer Hackathon 2023

[SingleStore](https://www.singlestore.com/) hosts two internal hackathons every year, where
employees are free to work on whatever they want - doesn't have to be useful in any way.

The theme of this hackathon was AI/ML, so we decided to try to do something with the vector
database stuff *SingleStore* provides us and also mix in some *OpenAI* shenanigans.

The goal of the project is still not very clear at the moment but we want to make something along
the lines of "There are multiple AI agents living in a Pokemon-like world, which must collaborate
to achieve tasks given by the user".
